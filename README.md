# DEVJACAutoBalancedLabel
Dead simple Objective-C UILabel subclass that balance text horizontally across several lines so all the lines have similar length and you don't end with a screen wide UILabel where the last line has only 1 word 

# FAQ
## How does it work?
It's dead simple, it just overrides this method `- (void)drawTextInRect:(CGRect)rect` and makes the UILabel belives it is actually less wider as it is so the text is rendered in a smaller Rect balancing the number of words per line.
