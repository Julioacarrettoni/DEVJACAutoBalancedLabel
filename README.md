# DEVJACAutoBalancedLabel
Dead simple Objective-C UILabel subclass that balance text horizontally across several lines so all the lines have similar length and you don't end with a screen wide UILabel where the last line has only 1 word 

# FAQ
### How does it work?
It's dead simple, it just overrides this method `- (void)drawTextInRect:(CGRect)rect` and makes the UILabel belives it is actually less wider as it is so the text is rendered in a smaller Rect balancing the number of words per line. 

### How does it look like?

### Installation?
Just drag and drop `DEVJACAutoBalancedLabel.h` and `DEVJACAutoBalancedLabel.m`to your project

### Usage?
On IB or when creating UILabels, just make it an instance of `DEVJACAutoBalancedLabel` instead of `UILabel``

### Swift version?
It is dead simple, just translate the code yourself! It takes more time to create the repo and push than to actually code it :P
Maybe later.

### License?
MIT orâ€¦ do what ever you want with it but if you can mention me somewhere or at least send me a tweet saying "thanks" I will appreciate it
